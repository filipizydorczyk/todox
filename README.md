Simple rest server based on [sealious](https://github.com/sealcode/sealious) that is going to be my personal todo app.

-   `npm run build` - builds js files to `build directory`
-   `npm starts` - run server locally (you need to run `docker-compose up -d` before this)
-   `npm tests` run tests (there is not really many tests, most of functionality is thanks to sealoius)
